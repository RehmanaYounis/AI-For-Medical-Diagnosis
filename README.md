# AI-For-Medical-Diagnosis (Coursera Course by DeepLearning.AI)

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. As an AI practitioner, you have the opportunity to join in this transformation of modern medicine. If you're already familiar with some of the math and coding behind AI algorithms, and are eager to develop your skills further to tackle challenges in the healthcare industry, then this specialization is for you. No prior medical expertise is required! 


- In Course 1,  create convolutional neural network image classification and segmentation models to make diagnoses of lung and brain disorders. 
- In Course 2,  build risk models and survival estimators for heart disease using statistical methods and a random forest predictor to determine patient prognosis. 
- In Course 3,  build a treatment effect predictor, apply model interpretation techniques and use natural language processing to extract information from radiology reports.
